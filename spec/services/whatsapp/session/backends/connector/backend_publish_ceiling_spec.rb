# The same question at every fire-and-forget site, asked of the source rather than of a
# checklist: how long may this command hold the session?
#
# A published command has no caller waiting on it, so whatever ceiling its frame declares
# is the only one the connector has for it, and the session's executor runs one command at
# a time -- one parked on a socket write is every send behind it parked too. A tenth site
# added without a ceiling would reintroduce that with nothing failing.
#
# There are two ceilings and they are not interchangeable. `timeout:` becomes `deadline`,
# an instant, and refuses the command unrun once it passes; `max_runtime:` is counted from
# the moment the work starts and can never drop anything. The teardown takes the second
# alone, which is exactly why it used to take neither: it is published so it can sit
# pending between owners, and a `session.logout` dropped for arriving late leaves a device
# listed on the customer's phone.
