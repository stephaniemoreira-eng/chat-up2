# The guards that make Import::SilentWrite mean something.
#
# Declared here, and not as autoloaded classes, on purpose: a reloadable module handed to
# `prepend` is a new object after every reload, so the ancestor chain would grow one copy
# per edit in development. These are defined once at boot and re-prepended to whatever
# generation of the class `to_prepare` hands over, which Ruby ignores when the module is
# already in the chain.
#
# Prepended rather than edited into the classes themselves: all three are files the
# upstream sync rewrites, and a guard clause inside them is a conflict on every merge.
module ImportGuards
  # A prepended module publishes whatever it defines, and every callback below except
  # `fetch_avatar_from_gravatar` is private on the model it guards. Left alone, a guard
  # would widen the model's public surface as a side effect of narrowing its behaviour --
  # `conversation.run_auto_assignment` and `message.execute_after_create_commit_callbacks`
  # callable from anywhere, on a fork whose whole premise is that the diff stays small.
  # Each guard restates the visibility the method already had; Rails invokes callbacks
  # through `send`, so private costs nothing.
  # Everything that acts on the world outside this request. An imported message may never
  # reach any of it, at either level of the flag: history that fires an automation, posts
  # an outgoing webhook or notifies an agent is history pretending to be an arrival.
  #
  # Stopped at enqueue rather than inside EventDispatcherJob, because the flag is scoped
  # to the importing thread and the job runs on another one, where it would read as unset.

    def dispatch(event_name, timestamp, data)
      return if Import::SilentWrite.on?

  # The two listeners that run in this thread. ActionCableListener is the push that moves
  # the operator's screen; AgentBotListener is a bot about to answer a message from June.
  # Under `:announce` the first is exactly what the import is for and the second is exactly
  # what it must not do, so the split is drawn by hand here instead of by the dispatcher.
  #
  # Wisper subscribes its listeners once, at boot, so there is no per-call listener set to
  # narrow: the announcing branch bypasses the publisher and calls the one listener it
  # allows, the same way the publisher would have. `respond_to?` because a listener only
  # implements the events it cares about, which is the check Wisper itself makes.

  # What the dispatcher does not cover: reopening a resolved conversation, the message
  # template hooks (an out-of-office reply to a message from June), the outgoing send, the
  # contact activity stamp and the conversation activity stamp. The importer sets the
  # activity stamps itself, because the callback moves them to whatever it just wrote and
  # history is written oldest first.
  #
  # One of the seven is a message to the screen rather than an action, and under `:announce`
  # the gap needs it: without `message.created` the conversation card in the list updates
  # and the thread the operator has open stays empty, which is a worse place to stop than
  # not updating at all.
  #
  # Only the event is re-emitted, not `dispatch_create_events`, which wraps it in bookkeeping
  # this importer has taken over: the first-reply branch writes `first_reply_created_at` and
  # clears `waiting_since`, and the other branch recomputes `waiting_since` from a message
  # being written oldest first. Both would fight `settle` for the same columns.
  # The two things that decide where a conversation goes and what state it is in. Both are
  # archive-only, and the level is the point: under `:announce` the thread is a gap somebody
  # is waiting on, and a gap thread that is neither assigned nor statused is one nobody
  # works until they happen to reload -- the exact failure the announcing level exists to
  # prevent.
  #
  # Assignment does not travel through the dispatcher, so nothing above stops it. An archive
  # thread is created resolved, and a status change to resolved is what wakes the V2
  # assignment job: once per conversation, half a million times over a full import, each
  # asking the inbox to redistribute capacity it has no reason to redistribute. The V1 path
  # is worse -- it assigns the thread outright, so a decade of somebody's history lands in a
  # working agent's queue.
  #
  # The bot override is narrower than the callback that carries it. `determine_conversation_status`
  # also resolves a conversation whose contact is blocked, which is right at either level and
  # is not the importer's business to undo, so only the bot half is stopped: an inbox with an
  # agent bot starts its conversations `pending` and overrides the `resolved` an archive
  # importer asked for on purpose.

  # The line a conversation writes about itself when one of its own columns moves, and the
  # one guard here that stops work rather than noise. `create_activity` does not act: it
  # enqueues `Conversations::ActivityMessageJob`, which creates a real Message on a Sidekiq
  # thread long after this one returned -- somewhere the flag is unset, so everything below
  # runs live. The dispatcher fires `message.created`, an agent bot answers it, the row
  # enqueues its own index job, and `set_conversation_activity` drags `last_activity_at` to
  # the time of the import. A thread from 2021 arrives at the top of the inbox wearing
  # today's date and a line nobody wrote.
  #
  # Stopped at both levels, unlike the guards around it, and the reason is not how loud the
  # write is: the job runs where no level reaches. Under `:announce` the sync dispatcher
  # lets exactly one listener through, and this path would hand the same event to all of
  # them a second later.
  #
  # Nothing reaches it as the import is driven today, and it is worth saying why the guard
  # is here anyway. One line comes close -- `apply_tags` calls `add_labels`, the single
  # `save` in an importer that writes everything else with `update_columns` -- and it stops
  # at `create_label_change`, which returns unless something named an actor. A rake task
  # names none. But that is ambient state the import does not own: the same importer driven
  # from a request carries the operator in `Current.user`, and then every tagged ticket
  # fires. The guard costs an early return on a callback that would not have run; not having
  # it costs an archive of activity lines nobody can take back.

  # `:archive` the row is years old, and `scheduled_at > created_at` is then true of every

  # `execute_after_create_commit_callbacks` does not carry.
  #
  # Stopped so the archive can be indexed properly, not so it can go unindexed -- being
  # searchable is most of why history is imported at all. `Import::HistorySettlement` hands
  # each settled batch to the index in one bulk pass instead, which Searchkick splits into
  # a job per thousand rows rather than a job per row. Half a million jobs is not a slower
  # import, it is a queue the live traffic is now standing behind: Sidekiq drains in the
  # order it received, and the reply an agent just sent waits for the archive.
  #
  # The one guard here that does not read the level, because the level is the wrong
  # question: what matters is whether the writer has taken the index on itself. Only the two
  # backfills have, and only they can afford to -- they outlive their settlements and end
  # somewhere they can flush. An importer handed a webhook's worth of rows and thrown away
  # keeps the per-row callback, and needs it: a batch of its that raised after some rows
