# Meta grants the Human Agent feature so that *a person* can answer a contact up to seven days
# after their last message; a reply sent by anything else belongs in the 24-hour window, as an
# ordinary response. Upstream stamps `tag: HUMAN_AGENT` on every outgoing Messenger and Instagram
# message once the installation flag is on, without looking at who wrote it, so an agent bot's
# reply goes out under a person's seal. That is use outside the approved case, and the penalty
# lands on the app that holds the feature, not on the message. Here nearly every inbox has a bot
# bound to it, so that is the default path rather than an edge case.
#
# Two halves:
#   * the seal goes out only when `Message#sender` is a User;
#   * Meta's refusal for a closed window, which a bot will now meet whenever it answers past 24
#     hours, is persisted as a sentence the agent can act on, in the account's language, instead
#     of "10 - (#10) This message is sent outside of allowed window. Learn more about...".
#
# Declared here instead of as autoloaded classes, and for the reason import_guards.rb gives: a
# reloadable module handed to `prepend` is a new object after every reload, so the ancestor chain
# would grow one copy per edit in development. Prepended rather than edited into the services:
# all four targets are files the upstream sync rewrites, and a guard clause inside them is a
# conflict on every merge.

  # attachment loop stops at the first refusal instead of offering each attachment to a window
  # that is closed, and `handle_facebook_error` still sees an untouched token error.

  # This leans on upstream persisting `e.message` rather than, say, "#{e.code} - #{e.message}".
