# The WhatsApp connector's event consumer runs inside Sidekiq by default: it is the
# process that is already there, already restarted on deploy, and already quiesced
# before shutdown. `WHATSAPP_CONNECTOR_CONSUMER=standalone` moves it to its own process
# (`rails whatsapp:consumer`), and `off` disables it.
#
# The flags are read straight from the environment here: application constants are not
# autoloadable yet while initializers run. The supervisor itself is built inside the
# startup hook, which fires long after boot.
