# Allow audio and video attachments (call recordings, voice notes, clips a contact sent)
# to serve inline so the in-app players can stream them. Without this, ActiveStorage's blob
# model forces Content-Disposition: attachment for any MIME outside the default allowlist
# (images + PDF), which makes the browser download instead of play.
#
# `Blob#url` applies `forced_disposition_for_serving || disposition`, so this list wins over
# whatever a caller asks for: an inline URL built for a type that is not here still serves
# as an attachment. Which is why the two halves ship together, here and in
# `Attachment#inline_storage_url`.
#
# Safari is the browser that made this visible. Chrome and Firefox play a `<video>` whose
# response says attachment; Safari refuses, so a video arrived as a file to download while
# the same code looked fine to anyone testing in Chrome.
#
# Nothing here is scriptable in the browser, which is what separates this list from
# `content_types_to_serve_as_binary` (svg, html): serving a clip inline renders a clip.
