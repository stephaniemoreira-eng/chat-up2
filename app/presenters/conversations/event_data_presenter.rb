  # What a contact is allowed to receive over the cable. This is an ALLOWLIST on
  # purpose: `contact_push_data` is built FROM this list, never subtracted from
  # `push_data`. A new field therefore reaches agents only, until someone adds it
  # here deliberately.
  #
  # A denylist was tried first and failed open. Every field added to `push_data`
  # leaked by default, and two did within a month: `last_non_activity_message`
  # (which resolves to a trailing private note, since `non_activity_messages`
  # filters `message_type` but not `private`) and, on Pro, `kanban_task` (board
  # name, funnel step names, and the agent roster with availability). Anything
  # operational — labels, custom attributes, priority, assignee, SLA — is agent
  # context and stays out by construction.
  #
  # The list is this short because that is what the contact actually consumes:
  # the widget store keeps only `id` and `status` from cable payloads
  # (widget/store/modules/conversationAttributes.js), and the typing handlers
  # read only `conversation.id`. The rest is here because it describes the
  # contact's own side of the conversation and costs nothing to keep, so a
  # widget change does not immediately land on this list. Everything else the
  # widget needs comes from its own REST endpoint, which is scoped to the
  # contact and unaffected by this.
  #
  # Only the cable is narrowed. `/api/v1/accounts/.../conversations` is
  # agent-authenticated and keeps serving the full payload.

  # per-account number, the same one `id` above carries) — never the primary key, which is a
  # different number for the same conversation and is what a consumer would silently mis-join on.
  #
  # ALWAYS present, nil included, and that is the opposite of group_left right above. The two look
  # alike and are not: a conversation does not stop being a group, but a pairing IS cleared — by a
  # re-entry whose token names no origin (see the widget controller). Omitting nil would make that
  # clear indistinguishable from "this conversation was never part of an episode", and a consumer
  # holding the previous pairing has no way to tell it to drop one. It kept acting on it.
  #
  # A Chatwoot without this change omits the key entirely, so absent still means "said nothing" — the
  # distinction a consumer needs is between an instance that speaks about pairings and one that does
  # not, and the key's presence is exactly that.
