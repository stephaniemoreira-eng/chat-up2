  # One page of conversations, the same unit the index endpoint serializes at. The partial does
  # per-row work (unread counts, the last non-activity message), so an uncapped list would let any
  # authenticated agent ask one worker to render the whole account. The dashboard chunks to match,
  # and an oversized batch is refused rather than truncated: a truncated answer is indistinguishable
  # from "these conversations are gone" to a caller that reconciles against it.
  SYNC_BATCH_SIZE = 25
  # One debounced batch of inbound messages, generously. The whole thread is never the answer,
  # since a receipt per message of history empties a year of unread badges on the contact's
  # phone, so this holds both branches of the endpoint to the same reach.
  #
  # A named list over it is refused and a resolved one is truncated, which is not a
  # contradiction: naming 51 ids is a claim about what the caller processed, and no
  # conversation flow produces it, so answering it at all would be answering a mistake. The
  # default names nothing, and the newest is then the only sensible part to keep.

  # The current state of the conversations the caller names, and nothing else. The dashboard asks
  # when its own list is longer than the count the server reports for a tab, a contradiction it
  # cannot resolve on its own: nothing in the store ever removes a conversation that left a tab, so
  # a single missed cable event leaves a stale copy behind forever.
  #
  # Deliberately ignores every tab filter, and that is the whole point: the caller is asking what
  # these conversations ARE, and the ones it is asking after are precisely the ones that stopped
  # matching its filters. What comes back replaces the stale rows, so they leave the tab through
  # their own data while keeping whatever other tab they still belong to. Whatever does not come
  # back is gone for this agent, deleted or no longer permitted, and the caller drops it.
  #
  # POST, and scoped to the ids it was given, so the answer can never outgrow the question: the
  # count that triggers the ask can itself be stale (a debounced meta answering for the filter
  # before last), so the tab can be far larger than the handful the client has on screen.

  #
  # The window is over the thread, NOT over the unread ones, and that distinction is the
  # whole safety property. Taking the newest N *unread* rows looks equivalent and walks
  # backwards through history instead: the provider echoes each receipt back, the echo writes
  # `read` on those rows, and the next call's newest-N-unread is then the fifty before them.
  # A bot answers every message, so a thread with a year of history behind it gets paged

  # The human path is not exposed to this because its watermark only moves forward. A bot

  # Message's default scope orders by `created_at` alone, and an imported row carries the
