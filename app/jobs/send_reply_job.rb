  # Whether this job was what would have put this message in front of the contact. Two ways
  # it was not, and in both a "failed to send" is a lie about a row nobody was sending.
  #
  # The channel: the widget broadcasts the reply over the cable and the API channel fires a
  # webhook, both when the message is created, so all this job does on those two is queue
  # the email-continuity notification. Its failure there is a failure to notify, not to
  # deliver, and marking the message would tell the agent to resend one the customer is
  # reading on screen. Asked of the routing table rather than a list of our own, which
  # would be a second place to keep in sync.
  #
  # The message: `perform` runs for every message that gets created -- the customer's own,
  # private notes, activity lines, bubbles for a voice call -- and it is
  # Base::SendOnChannelService that decides there is nothing to send, well after this job
  # has started. Its rule is mirrored here, deliberately and not delegated to: the service
  # is upstream's, its predicates are private, and instantiating one needs the concrete
  # channel class this job resolves. A job that died before reaching that decision never
  # got to find out, and those are the failures that fill the dead set: a database in
  # trouble takes out `Message.find` on the first line of `perform`.
  #
  # Mirrored whole, including the removed-reaction exception: that row is deleted on
  # purpose and its empty content is the payload that clears the emoji on the contact's
  # phone, so it is a send like any other and a send that failed has to say so.
