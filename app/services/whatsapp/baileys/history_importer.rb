# Files one chat's history into a Baileys inbox.
#
# A subclass of the webhook service, and that is the whole design. A `messaging-history.set`
# message is a `WAMessage`, byte for byte the shape `messages.upsert` carries, so an
# imported row can be made indistinguishable from a live one by running the code a live one
# runs: the same content extraction, the same fifteen content types, the same rich parsing,
# the same contact resolution. A translator written alongside it would be a second reading
# of the same payload, and the day the two disagree is the day history stops matching what
# the inbox already holds.
#
# What is not reused is the per-message ceremony around that pipeline, and each omission
# has a reason:
#
#   the message lock       the chat is held for the whole batch instead, so a live message
#                          for the same chat cannot open a second conversation beside the
#                          one being filled. The per-message lock lives in the same Redis
#                          namespace, so taking both would be this job waiting on itself.
#   the contact lookup     resolved once per run rather than once per message. Nine hundred
#                          messages is the difference between seconds and minutes.
#   the avatar fetch       skipped. A first pairing would otherwise ask the provider for
#                          five hundred profile pictures at once, which is how an instance
#                          gets rate limited on the day it is set up. A live message fills
#                          it in.
#   the conversation       picked by Inbound::ConversationFinder, which knows about the
#                          archive: a message from last year must not reopen work, and the
#                          reopen policy the live path follows would do exactly that.
#
# Everything the import may set off is suppressed by Import::SilentWrite for the
# whole run: no notifications, no automations, no outgoing webhooks, no bots, no
# out-of-office replies, no read receipts on the contact's phone. The gap half runs one
# level down, where the dashboard push survives, because somebody is watching the queue it
# lands in.
