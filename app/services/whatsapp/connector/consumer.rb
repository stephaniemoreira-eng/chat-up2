# Reads events off the connector's streams and hands them to the session dispatcher.
#
# Ordering is the whole point of the design: the connector puts every event of a
# session on the same shard, and exactly one consumer owns a shard at a time, so the
# events of one session are processed one at a time, in order, by one thread. That is
# why an event is dispatched inline instead of being turned into a job.
