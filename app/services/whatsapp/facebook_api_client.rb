  # Two calls, and only the first decides whether anything arrives at all.
  #
  # Subscribe app to WABA first — Meta requires it before any callback override (issue #13097).
  # subscribed_fields (incl. `calls` when voice is enabled) is declared here; the phone-level POST has no such field.
  #
  # The phone-level override takes precedence over WABA-level, so numbers on one WABA can route to different URLs.
  # It is also the half Meta refuses for a whole class of accounts that receive perfectly well without it: a
  # coexistence number whose WABA sits in the customer's own Business Manager answers `(#200) Permissions error`,
  # because the integrator's system user cannot manage a WABA in another portfolio. Under one rescue that refusal
  # reached `Channel::Whatsapp#setup_webhooks` as a setup failure, marked the channel for reauthorization, and
  # `Webhooks::WhatsappEventsJob` then discarded every inbound webhook for it: a number was dead for hours while
  # Meta kept delivering, nine webhooks in and no conversations out. So it is best effort here, the same way the
  # phone registration already is, and refused by the same accounts for the same reason.
  #
  # Answers whether that optional half landed. The required one raises when it fails, so reaching
  # the answer at all means Meta is delivering; `false` means it is delivering to whatever the
  # app's own callback says, which on an installation that points elsewhere is the difference
  # between a working inbox and a quiet one. The caller is what turns that answer into something
  # the operator can see.
