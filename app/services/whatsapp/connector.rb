# go on a per-session stream, events come back on sharded streams, and RPC answers on a
# short-lived list. Nothing about this is namespaced by Redis::Namespace: the keys are
# read and written by another process, so they are plain, prefixed keys.

  # The default tracks the connector's own `WAC_EVENT_SHARDS`, which is what an
  # installation that sets neither side ends up running. They drifted once, and the cost
  # was not the consumer, which follows what is published: it was the database pool,
  # sized from this number in `config/database.yml`, reserving half the connections the
  # consumer threads would ask for.

  # the inboxes sharded onto them silently deaf.
  # What the running connector says it publishes, or nil when it has not said anything
  # yet. The difference matters to anyone deciding whether the count has changed: the
  # local setting is a guess made before the connector was reachable, and taking it for
  # an announcement makes the connector's first real one look like a re-shard.
