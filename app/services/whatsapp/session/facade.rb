# The provider service of a session channel.
#
# Channel::Whatsapp talks to its provider in the shape the legacy providers established:
# a recipient id that is a phone number or a JID, a Chatwoot message, a group JID. This
# translates all of it into the canonical commands the backend takes, so the channel
# model, the group controllers and the presence services keep working untouched.
#
# Session-internal code does not come through here: it asks the channel for
# `session_backend` and speaks the canonical API directly.

  # Deliberately NOT `setup_channel_provider`. That one claims a pairing attempt, which writes

  # For a bulk re-assert those writes are the wrong shape twice over: the inbox this asked for
  # is the one that was recorded as `open`, so erasing that on a failure makes the retry skip

  # because there is no QR on anybody's screen to go stale.
