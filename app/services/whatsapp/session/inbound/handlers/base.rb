# Common ground for every inbound handler: what the event is about, and the four
# answers a handler may give.

#   :handled   the event changed something
#   :ignored   the event is not actionable here (disabled capability, unknown chat...)
#   :duplicate the event had already been processed
#   :deferred  the message this event is about is not stored yet
#
# `:deferred` is about delivery order, and only an unordered transport can act on it: an
# HTTP webhook can run an edit before the message it edits, so its job retries. The
# connector delivers a session's events in order, so there the target is genuinely absent
# and the answer means the same as `:ignored`.

  # inside the row lock); for everything else the dispatcher's check is the whole fence.
