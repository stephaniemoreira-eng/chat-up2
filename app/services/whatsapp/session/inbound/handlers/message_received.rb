  # bubble saying it could not be read forever, over a message whose text is in the
  # payload that was just dropped.
  #
  # The second is the work that was queued after the row was saved: an attempt that
  # committed the row and then failed, most often on the job transport, is retried and
  # lands here, and the media it meant to fetch would never be asked for again. The

  #
  # What it announces comes off the row, not off this delivery. The debt names the body it owes, and any
  # delivery that reaches here can pay it: the redelivered placeholder is the ordinary shape of this,
  # because the consumer's session cursor only moves forwards, so a debt is only ever reached once that
  # cursor is gone, and then the whole backlog replays in order with the placeholder ahead of the

  # the marker with it (`MessageWriter#settle`), and a redelivery after that writes nothing
  # and would be skipped by a check scoped to the rows being written. And it costs nothing
  # to ask: it returns on the spot when the message carries no attribution, and otherwise
  # fills only the keys that are still missing.
  #
  # Before the write, and that ordering is the point. Writing the content is what takes
  # the recovery marker off the row, so a failure after it would find the redelivery no
  # longer eligible and lose the attribution for good; failing here leaves the marker
  # where it is and the redelivery does all of it again.

  # not filter on content already matched the placeholder and already ran. That is #491.
  #
  # After the write rather than before it, unlike the attribution, because losing it
  # costs a stale preview until the next event touches that conversation rather than a
  # fact nothing else records. The media enqueue behind `reconcile` is in the same
  # position and is not lost either way: a redelivery that finds the row already written

    #
    # Before the preview refresh, which is the cheaper of the two to lose: a failure between the content
    # write and here leaves the automations unrun for good, because the redelivery finds the row already
    # written and comes back through the duplicate path. That is the behaviour this whole change is
    # about, so it must not be what a refresh of a chat list costs.
