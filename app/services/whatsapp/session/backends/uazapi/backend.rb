# The `uazapi` provider: a hosted WhatsApp gateway the customer already pays for, reached
# over HTTP. Chatwoot never provisions an instance here and never holds an admin token:
# the operator brings a base URL and an instance token, and this backend drives that one
# instance.
#
# Where the connector answers commands over Redis and pushes canonical events, this one
# calls REST endpoints and receives a webhook that WebhookTranslator turns into the same
# events. Above this class nothing knows the difference.
#
# WHAT IS PROVEN. The endpoints exercised against a live instance on 19/08/2026 are
# `/instance/{connect,disconnect,status,wa_messages_limits}`, `/webhook`, `/send/*`,
# `/message/{react,edit,markread,download,presence}`, `/chat/{check,details}` and
# `/group/{create,list,updateParticipants}`. The rest follow the provider's own docs and
# are confirmed by the end-to-end checklist, not by a recorded response. Two are known
# NOT to exist on that build: `/instance/logout` and `/group/invitelink` both answer 405,
# which is why logging out is a disconnect and why `group_invites` is not declared.

  # answered with the state from before: a closed session, no code, and a pairing screen
  # that never starts, which is how this looked the first time it was run against a live
