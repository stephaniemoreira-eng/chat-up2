  # one inside the datacentre.
  MEDIA_SEND_RATE = ENV.fetch('WHATSAPP_MEDIA_SEND_RATE_BYTES', 1.megabyte).to_i

  # The ceiling on that wait. A send holds a Redis connection out of the pool and the
  # worker that called it for as long as it runs, so a file too big to move inside this
  # is one this deployment does not send -- and it says so on the deadline rather than by
  # holding a worker indefinitely.

  # --- the ceiling on a published command ------------------------------------------
  #
  # A published command carries no `reply_to`, so nobody here is waiting to give up on it
  # and whatever ceiling the frame declares is the only limit the connector has. The
  # session's executor takes one command at a time, so a published command with no ceiling
  # at all, parked on a socket write, is every send behind it parked too.
  #
  # The frame offers two, and which one a command wants follows from what a late execution
  # would cost it. `deadline` is an instant, refusing the command unrun once it passes, so
  # it is for the commands that are wrong rather than merely late when they land. The
  # runtime ceiling below is counted from the moment the work starts and can never drop
  # anything, so it is for the ones that have to happen whenever they arrive.
  #
  # The timeouts here are deadlines. The teardown takes the other one, on its own constant.

  # A momentary state that lands late is not late, it is wrong: an `available` applied
  # after the agent went offline flips the account back, and a `composing` applied minutes
  # later is a typing bubble for something nobody is typing.
  MOMENTARY_TIMEOUT = 30

  # These are still right whenever they land, so the only reason to bound them is the
  # executor, and the ceiling has to clear the longest command that can legitimately be
  # ahead of them on the same queue: a send carrying a file. A queue holding several of
  # those back to back can still expire one, and what that costs is a receipt the
  # customer's phone never shows, repaired the next time the same chat is read.
  DEFERRABLE_TIMEOUT = MEDIA_SEND_MAX_TIMEOUT + Whatsapp::Connector::Client::RPC_TIMEOUT

  # A pairing code is worth as long as the attempt that asked for it, which is the ceiling
  # the pairing screen already runs on: past it, the screen the operator would type the
  # code into is gone.
  PAIRING_TIMEOUT = Whatsapp::Session::PairingPollJob::DEADLINES.fetch('code').to_i

  # The teardown takes the other ceiling, the one counted from when the work starts, and
  # takes it alone. A deadline would be the wrong half: a teardown is deliberately left
  # pending while the session is between owners, and refusing it for arriving late leaves
  # a device listed on the customer's phone with nothing here corresponding to it. What
  # the runtime ceiling bounds instead is a teardown parked on a socket write, and it
  # cannot drop anything, because the clock only starts once the connector picks it up.
  #
  # Generous, because the wait it exists to end is a half-open socket rather than a slow
  # answer: WhatsApp answers an unlink in well under a second, and a socket that is simply
  # down answers at once with a refusal. Everything the connector still owes itself after
  # the unlink runs outside this ceiling, by contract.

  end

  # The teardown, and the two halves go by different routes because they cover states the
  # other cannot reach.
  #
  # `session.delete` goes on the **control stream**, which every connector instance reads.
  # A connector reads `wa:cmd:<sid>` only for the sessions it is running, so a teardown
  # written there for an account nobody has adopted is delivered to nobody at all and dies
  # when the stream is trimmed -- and that is exactly the state a teardown is most often
  # sent in: an inbox destroyed while its session was down, or destroyed while the
  # connector fleet was restarting. On the control stream, whoever reads it adopts the
  # account for the length of the teardown and tears it down without ever connecting.
  #
  # The `session.logout` stays, on the session's own stream, and it is not redundant.
  # Delivery through the control stream is to *some* instance rather than to the one
  # running the account: an entry naming a session somebody else owns is left pending and
  # reclaimed until it reaches that owner, which happens but is not bounded. The logout
  # rides the owner's own stream, so for a session that is up the device is unlinked at
  # once, and the delete that follows finds nothing linked, which is a teardown with less
  # to do rather than a failure. It is also what keeps this working against a connector
  # build older than fazer-ai/whatsapp-connector#157, whose `session.delete` has no
  # handler and answers `unsupported`.
  #
  # Neither is `call`ed. This runs inside the transaction that destroys the inbox, and an
  # RPC there would hold it open for the round trip. And a teardown is deliberately left
  # pending, with no reply at all, while the session is between owners -- being handed
  # over, or waiting on a lease with room to finish -- so a caller waiting for an answer
  # would time out exactly when the connector is doing the right thing.
  #
  # Logged here, which is the only place it can be. The connector answers a teardown it
  # could not carry out with `command.failed`, and that event is routed to an inbox by
  # `session_id`: the inbox this one is about has just been destroyed, so the lookup
  # misses and the event is dropped as an orphan. What we publish is the last thing about
  # this session that anybody can see.
  #
  # The two ids go into the hash the log line carries. Ruby evaluates the values in the

  # ordering rather than leaving it to be read out of this comment.
