# Per-account switches for the WhatsApp session providers, and the two are named for
# what they do, which is not the same thing for both.
#
# `uazapi` is on offer: an account that nobody has touched can create one, and the switch
# takes it away from one account. `native` is the other way round, and deliberately: it
# is being rolled out to named accounts rather than announced, so nothing is on offer
# until somebody says so. A flag whose absence means "yes" cannot do a restricted
# rollout, because every account created after the switch is flipped joins the rollout
# without anyone deciding that.
#
# What decides whether a provider is served **at all** is still its descriptor, not
# these: `native` needs a connector reachable on this deployment's Redis and answers
# `available?` on that. These narrow what the descriptor already allows, in both
# directions, and neither can offer a provider this deployment does not serve.
#
# They live in the `settings` jsonb (see the "Account-level toggles" section in
# AGENTS.md), keyed by name, so bit positions never drift between CE and Pro.
#
# Include this AFTER the other `store_accessor :settings` calls in Account: the writers
# below reach the store-accessor module through `super`.

  # Deliberately not on the super admin form, either of them: these are console switches by
  # decision, so that offering the native channel to an account is a step somebody takes on
  # purpose rather than a checkbox next to the ordinary account settings.
  #
  # The cast stays because the value can still arrive as a string, from the settings API or
  # from a console line that types "1", and the settings JSON schema only accepts booleans.
