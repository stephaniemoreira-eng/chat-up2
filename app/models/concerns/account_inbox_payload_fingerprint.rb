# The inbox cache key answers "has an inbox changed"; the browser reads it as "is my cached
# copy still correct". Those are the same question only while the payload depends on nothing
# but the record, and it does not: `capabilities` follows WHATSAPP_GROUPS_ENABLED and
# `forwarding_enabled` follows MAILER_INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN. Flip either and every warm cache
# keeps serving rows built under the old setting, because no inbox was written and the key
# never moved. The same gap swallows a payload that grew a field on deploy.
#
# So the key carries a fingerprint of everything else the payload is derived from. Doing it
# here rather than in the dashboard is what makes it complete: the server is the only side
# that knows what it serialized, and one key covers every browser without the two versions
# having to be bumped in step.

  # Bump on any change to what that partial serializes -- its shape, and equally the
  # values it derives from code rather than from the record. A capability added to a
  # descriptor is the second kind and looks like nothing here: the field already existed,
  # no inbox was written, and every warm cache keeps serving the list from before the
  # deploy. The dashboard then hides the controls the new capability was added to unlock,
  # until something happens to write the inbox row.
