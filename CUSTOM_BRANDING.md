# Custom branding

## Brand configuration

Export environment variables and run rake task with `bundle exec rails branding:update`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unset environment variables are reset to default values.

```bash
INSTALLATION_NAME="Chatwoot fazer.ai" \
BRAND_NAME="My Company" \
LOGO_THUMBNAIL="https://fazer.ai/logo-thumbnail.svg" \
LOGO="https://fazer.ai/logo.svg" \
bundle exec rails branding:update
```

| Environment variable | Default Value                               | Description                                                           |
| :--------------------| :------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INSTALLATION_NAME`  | `Chatwoot`                                  | The installation-wide name used in the dashboard, title, etc.         |
| `LOGO_THUMBNAIL`     | `/brand-assets/logo_thumbnail.svg`          | The thumbnail used for favicon (512px X 512px).                       |
| `LOGO`               | `/brand-assets/logo.svg`                    | The logo used on the dashboard, login page, etc.                      |
| `LOGO_DARK`          | `/brand-assets/logo_dark.svg`               | The logo used on the dashboard, login page, etc. for dark mode.       |
| `LOGO_EMAIL`         | _(empty)_                                   | The logo shown at the top of outgoing emails. **PNG, JPG or GIF only** — email clients do not render SVG. A relative path resolves against `FRONTEND_URL`. Left empty, `LOGO` is used when it is one of those formats, and no logo is shown otherwise. |
| `BRAND_URL`          | `https://www.chatwoot.com`                  | The URL used in emails under the section “Powered By”.                |
| `WIDGET_BRAND_URL`   | `https://www.chatwoot.com`                  | The URL used in the widget under the section “Powered By”.            |
| `BRAND_NAME`         | `Chatwoot`                                  | The name used in emails and the widget.                               |
| `TERMS_URL`          | `https://www.chatwoot.com/terms-of-service` | The terms of service URL displayed on the Signup Page.                |
| `PRIVACY_URL`        | `https://www.chatwoot.com/privacy-policy`   | The privacy policy URL displayed in the app.                          |
| `DISPLAY_MANIFEST`   | `true`                                      | Display default Chatwoot metadata like favicons and upgrade warnings. |

## Per-account branding

The configuration above is installation-wide, which is what a single-tenant install wants. An installation that hosts several companies usually wants the opposite: an account's emails should carry that account's brand, not the installation owner's.

Enable the `branded_email_templates` feature for the account, then set the brand under **Settings → General → Email branding**:

| Field         | Falls back to                                                |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brand name    | `BRAND_NAME`                                                 |
| Brand website | `BRAND_URL`                                                  |
| Brand color   | `BRAND_COLOR`                                                |
| Email logo    | `LOGO_EMAIL`, then `LOGO` when it is a raster format         |

The fallback is field by field, so an account that sets only a colour keeps the installation's name and logo. An account that sets nothing behaves exactly as before.

The email logo is uploaded rather than referenced by URL, and is served by this installation, so the link inside an email does not expire the way a signed storage URL would. PNG, JPG and GIF only, up to 2 MB: no mail client renders SVG.

### On the CSAT survey page

The public survey page a contact opens from a CSAT request wears the same brand, resolved from the conversation:

| Field         | Where it shows                                                            |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Brand name    | The browser tab, and the "Powered by" line in the footer                  |
| Brand website | Where that footer line links                                              |
| Brand color   | The confirm and submit buttons, the selected rating, and the focus rings  |
| Email logo    | The footer mark, and the top of the page when the inbox has no avatar     |

Enable `disable_branding` on the account to drop the footer line entirely, the same way the widget and the help center portal already honour it.

> [!NOTE]
> This covers what a customer of the account sees: their email, and the public survey page. The dashboard, the login page, the favicon, the PWA manifest and the widget are the installation's own surfaces and always use the installation branding.

## Favicon and other assets

Update the favicon files in the [`public/`](public/) folder.

Can also be done by creating a zip file with relevant files, and running [`deployment/extract_brand_assets.sh`](deployment/extract_brand_assets.sh) to override the existing favicons with your own.
In this case, the zip file should be a flat archive containing the following files:

```

> [!NOTE]
> You can include other assets in the zip file, and use them when running the rake task for `LOGO_THUMBNAIL`, `LOGO`, and `LOGO_DARK`.
> See [Brand configuration](#brand-configuration).
